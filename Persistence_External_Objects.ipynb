        "# Persistence of External Objects\n",
        "\n",
        "For the benefit of object persistence, the pickle module supports the notion of a reference to an object outside the pickled data stream. Such objects are referenced by a persistent ID, which should be either a string of alphanumeric characters (for protocol 0) 5 or just an arbitrary object (for any newer protocol).\n",
        "\n",
        "The resolution of such persistent IDs is not defined by the pickle module; it will delegate this resolution to the user-defined methods on the pickler and unpickler, persistent_id() and persistent_load() respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "To pickle objects that have an external persistent ID, the pickler must have a custom persistent_id() method that takes an object as an argument and returns either None or the persistent ID for that object. When None is returned, the pickler simply pickles the object as normal. When a persistent ID string is returned, the pickler will pickle that object, along with a marker so that the unpickler will recognize it as a persistent ID.\n",
        "\n",
        "To unpickle external objects, the unpickler must have a custom persistent_load() method that takes a persistent ID object and returns the referenced object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is a comprehensive example presenting how persistent ID can be used to pickle external objects by reference."
